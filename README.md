Recipe Manager Application
This README provides instructions on how to compile and run the Recipe Manager application, which is a simple console application written in C# using .NET Framework 4.8.

Prerequisites
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8
- A compatible IDE for .NET development (e.g., Visual Studio 2022)


Setup Environment

Ensure you have the .NET Framework 4.8 installed on your system. You can check your installed versions from the Control Panel under Programs and Features, or by checking the registry.

If you do not have the .NET Framework installed, you can download it from [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48).


Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/ST10303017/ST10303017_PROG6221_POE.git


Compiling the Application

Open the solution file `.sln` in Visual Studio. Once open, you can build the project by navigating to:

Build -> Build Solution

This will compile the application and check for any compile-time errors.


Running the Application

After successfully compiling the application, you can run it directly from Visual Studio by pressing F5 or by navigating to:

Debug -> Start Debugging

This will start the application and you will see the Recipe Manager's menu prompt in the console.


Usage

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the Recipe Manager. The application allows you to:
- Create a new recipe
- Display a recipe
- Scale a recipe
- Reset ingredient quantities
- Clear all recipe data
- Exit the application
